# Pizzeria Menu Project

## Description

This project is a React-based pizzeria menu application developed with Vite. It features a user-friendly interface to display and manage the menu, with routing, state management, and local storage integration. The project also includes a navigation bar for seamless user experience.

### Key Features

* **React Components**: The menu is built using reusable React components.
* **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` for managing the application state.
* **Side Effects Management**: Incorporates `useEffect` for local storage synchronization.
* **Routing**: Configures routes for `Home` and `Owner` pages.
* **Navbar**: Includes a responsive navigation bar.

### Commit Message Example

"I created the pizzeria menu using React components and utilized the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks with local storage. Additionally, I set up the routes for the files from `Home` and `Owner` and added a `Navbar`."

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

### Official Plugins

* **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
* **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

### Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TypeScript template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#typescript) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` in your project.
